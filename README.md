xparallax.js
============
#### parallax on the x-axis
#### with tweening

- A horizontal parallax scroll derived from: http://www.pixxelfactory.net/jInvertScroll/

- but built to function more cleanly on mobile
	- touch - swipe handling
	- responsive 
		Tested With
			- Chrome w/ Touch
			- Chrome for Android
			- Android Stock
			- Firefox and Safari - no-touch :(
			- IE 11 w/Touch
			- Opera w/ Touch

- this does not use any requestAnimation Frames.
- 3D bug in the background via: http://codepen.io/jbeeio/pen/oHDrk


-scrollr.js and betterPar are included in this repository, so that one day I can integrate them
